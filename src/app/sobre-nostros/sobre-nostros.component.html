            </h1>
            <p>Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.

                These Angular docs help you learn and use the Angular framework and development platform, from your first application to optimizing complex single-page apps for enterprises. Tutorials and guides include downloadable examples to accelerate your projects.</p>
            <p>Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
                </li>
                <li>A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more
                </li>
                <li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code
                     /li>
            </ul>
            <p>With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. Angular is designed to make updating as straightforward as possible, so take advantage of the latest developments with a minimum of effort. Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.
